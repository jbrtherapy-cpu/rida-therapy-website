            <h2>Your Guide to a Healthier Mind</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Jabran. I am a BACP Accredited Psychotherapist with over 10 years of experience helping people find clarity and peace. From my bases in Oldham and Manchester, I have been privileged to help clients across the globe, including in Dubai, Hong Kong, the USA, Ethiopia, and beyond.</p>
            <p>This international experience has given me a deep understanding of how messy and complex life can be. I have a special focus on helping clients navigate the delicate balance of cultural expectations, generational trauma, and immigrant family dynamics. I appreciate the courage it takes to question traditional advice and forge your own path.</p>
            <p>My role isn't to judge your background, but to honour your experience. Together, in a confidential setting, we will explore your challenges and uncover the tools you already possess to build a life that feels authentic to you.</p>
